# Rmarkdown Reporting Code
This subdirectory is used to provide example code of reporting from Acoustic Surveys for Small Pelagics. The integretations occured in Echoview and the relies on [EchoviewR](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR#readme) to provide some automation. While this code can be run without integretations for those who are interested and have Echoview, please follow the README below to get [EchoviewR](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR#readme) to work with the most recent versions of R and Echoview.




- a free interface between Echoview (R) and R using COM scripting.
